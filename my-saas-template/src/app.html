        <!-- For SvelteKit, importing app.css in a root +layout.svelte or +layout.ts 
             is the standard way to include global CSS.
             Explicitly linking app.css here is usually not needed if src/app.css exists
             and is imported by SvelteKit's build process (e.g. via +layout.svelte).
             However, Skeleton V3 examples sometimes show it directly or rely on it being processed.
             SvelteKit should automatically inject styles from `src/app.css` if it's processed
             as part of the component tree (e.g. imported in +layout.svelte).
             Let's ensure it's robust. If src/app.css is imported by +layout.svelte (or its module script)
             or a similar root Svelte file, SvelteKit handles it.
             The new Skeleton v3 setup has app.css with @import rules.
             This app.css needs to be processed. Importing it in +layout.svelte's module script
             is a common way.
